##    summary: |
##      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the relativistic astrophysics group at Goethe University Frankfurt. I am broadly interested in the behavior of strongly interacting matter at high densities and exploring this region of the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force.

Primarily I study the equation of state of neutron-star matter, and specifically I have worked to synthesize inputs from astrophysics, nuclear theory, and particle theory to bound its behavior within the cores of the most massive neutron stars, with the aim of constraining the phase of matter reached in the cores of these objects. My research is interdisciplinary and consists of analytic calculations using perturbative QCD itself as well as numerical and statistical techniques to perform Bayesian equation-of-state inference.

Recently I have also begun to explore transport properties of cold and dense matter, which are more sensitive to the degrees of freedom than thermodynamic properties are.
